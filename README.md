# Opencut Reinforced

A free and open-source cross-platform video editor designed around one structured editing core shared by the human interface, CLI automation, and AI agents.

## Status

**Pre-MVP: architecture blueprint v1 complete; application implementation has not started.** This repository does not yet contain a production Flutter or Rust editing application and does not release application binaries. The interactive HTML prototype is a frozen product and UX reference, not the final application or its production architecture.

## Vision

OR aims to be a powerful but approachable editor that is desktop-first, Android-capable, local-first where practical, agent-native, and open to community-created content. Editing state should stay structured and inspectable, and editing behavior should be deterministic across the GUI, CLI, and agents.

## Core architecture

The following is the intended direction, not an implemented application:

    Flutter UI
        |
    shared Command API  <--- CLI
        |                 <--- Agents
    Rust Core
        |
    Timeline / Media / Render

Flutter is the presentation layer. The Rust core is intended to own editing and project truth so the GUI, CLI, and agents do not grow separate editing engines.

## Product direction

The planned product covers project and timeline editing, text and captions, audio, color and effects, export and interchange, creative assets, templates and themes, local and optional cloud AI, dubbing, safe agent and CLI workflows, and a future community ecosystem.

## Platforms

Current intended release targets:

- macOS
- Windows
- Linux
- Android

iOS and web are not current release targets.

## Design and documentation

The application design source of truth is [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). The full documentation map is [docs/INDEX.md](docs/INDEX.md), including the [product vision](docs/PRODUCT.md), [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), and [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md).
