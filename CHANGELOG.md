# Changelog

All notable changes to Opencut Reinforced are recorded here.

This project is **pre-MVP**. There are no stable releases. Developer Preview
packages (`dev-<sha>`) are debug builds produced from `main`, expire after a
short window, and are not production installers. Nothing below is a stability
or compatibility promise.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once stable
releases exist. See [docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md) for how a release is
produced, and [docs/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md](docs/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md) for what the
product still needs.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Empty new projects present a working **Import Media** action that reaches the
  existing platform picker and permission path, on desktop and compact layouts.
- **Folder import**: selecting a folder imports the selected files plus files in
  its nested subdirectories, through the same picker and permission path.
- **Recent project return**: a recently opened project can be reopened from the
  Home surface after an application restart; on Android the persisted recent URI
  is rebound through a fresh SAF picker grant.
- `docs/evidence/claims/` records machine-readable verification claims for
  product requirements, with the run, job, evidence class and limitations each
  one does and does not establish.

### Changed

- **Add to Timeline** now inserts at the occupied timeline's content end rather
  than at the timeline origin.
- Home no longer presents the visual-only editor shell as a usable project.
- Documentation reorganised: the paused checkpoint ledger moved to
  `docs/archive/execution/`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` is labelled archival, and
  `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` selects work from the product roadmap instead of the
  historical `NEXT` cursor.

### Added (infrastructure)

- `scripts/check_doc_links.py` — verifies that relative links in tracked Markdown
  resolve. Run by repository hygiene.
- `scripts/check_doc_freshness.sh` — verifies that documents making current
  claims carry a recent `Last reviewed` date.
- `scripts/check_claims.py` — validates claim-record schema and honesty fields.

## Verification

Every claim above has a dated record under [docs/evidence/claims/](docs/evidence/claims/),
naming the implementation SHA and the hosted run that verified it. Exact
measurement, platform scope and limitations are in
[docs/evidence/PRODUCT_ROADMAP_HISTORY.md](docs/evidence/PRODUCT_ROADMAP_HISTORY.md).

Physical-device performance, Android transcription, clean-machine
install/upgrade/uninstall, and ordinary-user dogfood remain unverified. Emulator
evidence does not establish any of them.
