# Testing Strategy

## Status

The production application test suites below are planned. The repository currently has documentation, repository safeguards, and an interactive prototype rather than a production Flutter or Rust editor. Repository hygiene checks and prototype acceptance checks do not demonstrate production product behavior.

## Test pyramid

### Rust domain and application unit tests

Test deterministic commands, queries, project rules, timeline operations, errors, and undo behavior close to the domain code.

Property and invariant tests should cover:

- valid timeline ranges and ordering
- stable IDs and reference integrity
- undo and redo restoring equivalent state
- rational time conversions and frame boundaries
- transactional rollback on failure

### Serialization and command contracts

- project serialization round trips
- forward migrations from supported prior versions
- malformed, truncated, oversized, and corrupt project input
- command schema and validation contracts
- query schemas, capability discovery, and structured errors
- atomic save and crash journal recovery

### CLI and agent contracts

- stable command discovery and exit-code categories
- JSON output shape and versioning
- headless and attached behavior
- dry-run does not mutate state
- EditPlan schema, unknown command rejection, permissions, diff, apply, and undo
- secrets never appear in CLI, agent output, logs, or errors

### Flutter and UX

- Flutter widget tests for controls, panels, focus, and state rendering
- [UX_ACCEPTANCE.md](UX_ACCEPTANCE.md) for preserved interaction invariants
- keyboard navigation and accessibility semantics
- mobile sheet, touch target, and timeline interaction checks

### Render, audio, media, and export integration

- deterministic render golden frames
- effect and color golden tests
- audio/video clock synchronization and seek behavior
- export output verification for container, streams, duration, dimensions, and expected frames
- media probing, decode, encode, and FFmpeg configuration checks
- platform-specific GPU and texture fallback coverage

### Data, platform, and security

- Android storage and media integration
- macOS integration
- Windows and Linux CI coverage
- plugin sandbox and capability tests when plugins exist
- template and theme schema validation, including rejection of executable content
- untrusted project, subtitle, media metadata, archive, model, and agent-output tests
- permission and secret-boundary tests
- crash recovery, memory, leak, and performance tests

## Fixtures and results

Use tiny, self-created or legally safe media fixtures. Keep fixture provenance and rights clear. Avoid shipping downloaded models or copyrighted media as test data.

A check that did not run must never be reported as passing. Report its exact status and reason. Keep a failing or unavailable check visible rather than silently omitting it. Prototype simulation tests are not production application tests.
